                <h3>User Interviews</h3>
                <p>For the user research phase, we organized a series of interviews with target users to identify their expectations, motivations and frustrations.</p>

                <h4>Questions & Insights</h4>

                <p><b>"What are the reasons that encourage you to wear makeup / learn how to apply makeup?"</b></p>
                <p>All interviewees mentioned self-confidence as their main reason for wearing makeup.</p>

                <p><b>"What criteria do you pay attention to when buying beauty products?"</b></p>
                <p>Interviewees mostly pay attention to: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>the ingredients ("how chemical is it and how is my skin going to react to it?"),</li>
                    <li>the price ("is it within my budget?"),</li> 
                    <li>the brand's ethics ("is it cruelty-free?"),</li> 
                    <li>user-friendliness.</li>
                </ol>

                <p><b>"What makeup techniques you haven't mastered yet would you like to learn? What has stopped you so far?"</b></p>
                <p>Interviewees all mentioned different makeup techniques they would like to learn. The techniques they mentioned seem to match their respective level: beginners mentioned basic techniques such as applying lipstick ("which shade should I pick based on my skin color?"), while advanced-level interviewees mentioned more complex techniques such as contouring ("I don't understand my face shape"). The main reason mentioned for not learning or mastering those techniques yet is not knowing where to start due to the myriad of beauty content out there.</p>

                <p><b>"Where do you usually look for makeup inspiration or advice?"</b></p>
                <p>Younger interviewees like to watch youtube or tiktok videos for makeup inspiration while older interviewees prefer magazine articles.</p>

                <p><b>"How well do you generally feel represented in beauty media (based on your skin color, age, etc.?)"</b></p>
                <p>Non-white, male and older interviewees feel underrepresented in beauty media, resulting in them being unsure how to apply makeup appropriately in regard to their features.</p>
